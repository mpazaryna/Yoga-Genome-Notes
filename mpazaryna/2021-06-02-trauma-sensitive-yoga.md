As a teacher we need to be trauma-informed

Start any yoga experience with a grounding moment, this can be breathing.  But, you need to be mindful, some breathing exercises will be bad for trauma folks.

Belly breathing is a good way to start
Chest breathing is an indication of exertion, danger or stress

4 to 6 breathing 
breath in to 4 and exhale to 6
counting breath is very helpful for trauma sensitive class
rule of thumb, longer exhale is better for trauma

Yoga sensitive sequencing should have a choice 

## What can trigger trauma
- Any experience that makes a person feel unsafe can be a trigger for trauma
- Passed through pass generations
- Abuse
- Witnessing substance abuse

## Patterns of Trauma
- hyperarousal
- emotional/physical reactions
- ptsd
- disconnect between body and mind

## Trauma affects the body
- increased cortisol and adrenaline
- breath and heart rate increase
- muscle tension, breath change

## Trauma affects the mind and spirit
- fight, flight, freeze
- reaction to threat
- inability to relax
- feeling numb

## How does yoga help?
- connect breath to body
- get out of mind and into body
- orient time and space, coming into the now and here
- slower practices are much better for trauma and getting things slower
- faster things may trigger unwanted memories

## Teaching principals
- get there early
- brief eye contact
- orient the mat towards the door, so you can see who's coming in
- don't walk behind students
- stay on or near your mat
- do not offer hands on adjustments
- repeat and rephrase directions
