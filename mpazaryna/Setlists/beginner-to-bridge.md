**Write a paragraph about your experience practicing it and teaching it to a beginner.**

This redo of the original assignment feels more centered and a better over all experience. The general warm up section, this time around, speaks to a more well rounded start appropriate for a beginner.  I felt more confident in the flow and the cues were coming more naturally.

**How did it feel in your body?**

This redo of the original assignment feels much more in line with my own daily personal practice.

**Did you change anything after teacher a beginner? **

This is the second submission of the original assignment, I removed what was originally a challenging general warm up.
